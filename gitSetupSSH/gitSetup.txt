This more or less follows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgZIv5HI44o

Make an ssh key on your computer
ssh-keygen -t rsa
(just press enter (no email, no passphrase) until key has been generated


Start ssh agent (should output "Agent pid <someNumber>")
eval $(ssh-agent -s)


Add ssh key to default location
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa


Link your ssh key to your github account (copy-paste public key from ~/.ssh/id_rsa)
github profile -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> add new ssh key


Download the repository
git clone <repo link>
(confirm that you want to continue connecting)

try git status etc.
