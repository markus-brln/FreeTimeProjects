- Again used the MVC pattern template and experience with numba cuda
  to make conway's game of life.
- RULES:
   - If the cell is alive, then it stays alive if it has either
     2 or 3 live neighbors.
   - If the cell is dead, then it springs to life only in the case
     that it has 3 live neighbors.

- benchmarks:
  - 285 fps, 300 size
  - 72 fps, 300 size, upscale to 600
  - ~400 fps, 300 size, no display -> screen update on CPU is bottleneck
  - ~110 fps, 500 size, no upscaling

 - changed arrays to np.uint8, trying to mitigate bottleneck of updating and
   CPU-GPU data transfer -> 230 fps, 500 size, no upscaling
