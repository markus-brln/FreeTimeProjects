This is a 2D gravity simulation based on my raytracing engine
(https://github.com/markus-brln/ComputerGraphicsCompetition2021)
as this came with the SFML window and other helpful things and
was easy to build upon.

3D gravity sim with 3D flying features like in raytracing engine
is planned, just without the raytracing and more traditional
rendering instead.
